# Bank Performance Optimization Using AI

**Descriptive Analysis**
Descriptive analysis was conducted to understand the current state of the bank’s customer base and identify key trends and patterns. Various visualization techniques were used, including:
•	Bar Charts: To compare categorical data and highlight differences in customer segments.
•	Pie Charts: To show the composition of different customer groups.
•	Histograms: To illustrate the distribution of continuous variables such as age and account balance.
•	Box Plots: To summarize the distribution of data and identify outliers.

**Predictive Analysis**
Predictive analysis was carried out using a machine learning predictive model. The decision tree model, a supervised learning artificial intelligence technique, was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in classification tasks.
•	Decision Tree: This model splits the data into branches to make decisions based on the input features, ultimately predicting whether a customer is likely to churn. By analysing the patterns and rules derived from the decision tree, the bank can identify high-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

**Benefits**
By integrating these advanced analytical techniques, the bank can:
•	Improve Customer Retention: Predictive modelling helps identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing the bank to take proactive measures.
•	Enhance Overall Performance: With better retention strategies, the bank can maintain a stable customer base, leading to improved financial performance.
•	Data-Driven Decision Making: The insights gained from descriptive and predictive analyses empower the bank to make informed decisions based on data rather than intuition.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the importance of leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, to enhance organizational performance. By predicting customer churn and analysing customer data, the bank can significantly improve its customer retention rates and overall efficiency.
